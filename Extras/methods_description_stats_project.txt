Data and Methods – Food Prices & Global Drivers Project

1. Research question
Our project focuses on the association between global food prices and a set of macro and
environmental drivers. A concise working question is:
"How are movements in the FAO Food Price Index associated with energy prices, freight/shipping
costs, global temperature anomalies, and the HKD/USD exchange rate at the monthly frequency?"

2. Data overview
Type of data: Multivariate monthly time series.
Planned sample: From 2010 onwards, restricted to the maximum common period across all series.
Unit of observation: Calendar month (single global aggregate for each variable).

Key variables:
- FAO Food Price Index (headline food index and sub-indices for cereals, vegetable oils, dairy, meat, sugar).
- Global energy price index.
- Global freight/shipping cost index.
- NOAA global surface temperature anomaly series.
- HKD/USD nominal exchange rate.

3. Data sources and collection process
3.1 FAO Food Price Index
The FAO Food Price Index (FFPI) is downloaded using the provided Python utility food_index.py, which
automatically discovers the most recent FAO FFPI file, downloads it, and normalizes the table into a
clean monthly time series. The script outputs ffpi_monthly.csv and ffpi_monthly.xlsx with columns
for the headline food index (ffpi_food) and sub-indices (ffpi_cereals, ffpi_veg_oils, ffpi_dairy,
ffpi_meat, ffpi_sugar), plus metadata on units, base period, and source.

3.2 Other drivers (energy, freight, temperature, FX)
Each teammate is responsible for one driver series. For each series, the responsible member must:
1) Obtain an official monthly series from a reputable provider.
2) Document the exact definition, units, base year (if an index), and original download link.
3) Export the data as a clean CSV/Excel file with one row per month and a consistent date column.
4) Record all details in the shared variable dictionary file.

4. Data cleaning and construction of the final dataset
Steps:
1) Convert all series to a common monthly date variable (YYYY-MM-01) and check for duplicate or missing months.
2) Inspect each raw series for obvious data entry errors, structural breaks, or extreme outliers.
3) If a series is higher frequency, aggregate to monthly averages or end-of-month values.
4) Align start/end dates across all series and restrict the sample to the overlapping period.
5) Optionally construct transformed variables (logs, monthly/annual percentage changes).
6) Merge the series into a single wide-format dataset using the date variable as key.

5. Planned statistical use
The focus of this course project is data collection and construction of a clean dataset suitable for
later econometric analysis (regression of quantitative variables). We design the data so that subsequent
work can fit simple and multiple regression models relating food prices to the selected drivers and test
for associations between quantitative variables.

6. Limitations and data quality checks
We may face differences in base years and units across indices, data revisions, and incomplete coverage
for some indicators. We mitigate these issues by relying on official sources, documenting every
transformation in the dictionary, and keeping a reproducible record of scripts/raw downloads.
